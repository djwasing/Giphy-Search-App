# Giphy Search App

With this project the goal was to essentially recreate a Giphy search on a website. I used ajax calls to get the images from the Giphy API, then jQuery to dynamically populate the images on the screen. The next challenge was to show the images in a still form, then animate when they were clicked. To do this I had to get the proper element within the returned object, then change it to the animated one on click. 

I did not style this site very much in order to focus on the functionality.
